# Corn-Production-and-Time-Zones-
This Project is a little research on the question : Does Time Zone affects the Production Of Corns in USA?
This is a Python-based Data Science Project on Pandas and Matplotlib . The Datasets used in the files are as follows:

A little About the code

This visual compares the crop production in American States during the time 1919-2017 . The States are grouped by their respective time zones they follow. The Data is then cleaned and the impurities is filtered out using various pandas functions. Since then the data is grouped in the group of four i.e. Mountain Standard Time Corns Production,Pacific Standard Time Corns Production,Eastern Standard Time Corns Production & Central Standard Time. Then the groups are plotted and it is realised that Central Standard Time Zone States and Eastern Standard Time Zone States had a magnificent increase in the production. However other factors like the number of states following a certain standard may varies, or the climatic conditions are not taken into consideration.
